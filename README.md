# Tepid-Tire-Calculator
A utility to compare the volume of two different (bicycle) tires.

# How
A bike tire is basically a torus, or at least it's close enough to a torus that we can use the volume of a torus to approximate the volume of a tire. As such, we calculate the volume of a torus based on the ISO rim diameter and tire width (like 622-40 for a 700x40c tire). We can calculate multiple tires and compare them to each other, as long as we calculate the volumes the same way.
